# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting credit card fraud. The project is designed to help financial institutions minimize losses by identifying and flagging suspicious transactions.


# Credit Card Fraud Detection Code

This Python script is designed for credit card fraud detection using a machine learning approach, particularly with a Random Forest Classifier.

# The script performs the following steps:

# 1. Load and Explore Data:
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Display a preview of the dataset, its shape, and basic statistics.
- Determine the number of fraud and valid transactions.

# 2. Data Visualization:
- Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap to understand feature relationships.

# 3. Data Preprocessing:
- Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (Y).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.

# 4. Random Forest Classifier:
- Build a Random Forest Classifier model.
- Train the model on the training set.
- Make predictions on the test set.

# 5. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient.
- Display a confusion matrix to visualize the classifier's performance.
